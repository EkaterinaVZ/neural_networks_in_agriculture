## Dataset properties

Total number of images: 2026.

Training set size: 1520 images.

Test set size: 506 images.

Number of classes: 2 (ripe_tomatoes, unripe_tomatoes).

Image size: 224x224 pixels.

Filename format: ripe_tomatoes.index.jpg(e.g. ripe_tomatoes.0.jpg), unripe_tomatoes.index.jpg(e.g. ripe_tomatoes.19.jpg)

Ripe and unripe tomatoes belong to two different classes.

## Repository structure

Folders Training and Test contain all images used for training and testing.

Ripe and unripe tomatoes belong to two different classes. The main part of images was unloaded using a script (code), then the images were checked and selected in manual way. Small part of the data consists of prepared photographs. It is a convenient tool for classifying fruits into ripe and unripe. If needed the additional required data (and classes) can be added to the set to expand the use of classification.
